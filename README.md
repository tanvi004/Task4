# Task4
This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to help stakeholders analyze car sales, pricing, and condition trends. Using a Kaggle dataset with around 5,58,833 records from 1982 to 2015, key metrics such as average selling price (₹13,611), total cars sold (5,58,833), average MMR value (₹13,769), and average condition score (30.67) were highlighted. The dashboard included sheets analyzing selling price by make, sales distribution by state, a heatmap of car conditions, and a time-series of average selling prices. Insights showed that Toyota and Hyundai had the highest sales, Florida, California, and Pennsylvania were top states, and newer cars showed increasing price trends. The repository contains the Tableau workbook, dashboard screenshots, a PowerPoint summary, and the dataset.
